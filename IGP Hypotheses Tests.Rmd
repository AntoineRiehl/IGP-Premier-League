## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(nnet)
library(broom)
library(car)
library(performance)
library(caret)
```
```{r}
install.packages("car")
install.packages("janitor")
```
```{r}

library(car)
library(janitor)

```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

data <- read_excel("/Users/edward/Documents/Documents – Edward’s MacBook Pro/Year 1/Year 2/IGP/EPL data.xlsx", sheet = "European Qualification")

# Clean column names (lowercase, snake_case)
data <- clean_names(data)

# View structure
head(data)




```



```{r}


data$end_status <- as.factor(data$end_status)

# Setting the parameters so the end status is compared with 'Survived'
data$end_status <- relevel(as.factor(data$end_status), ref = "Survived")

#Designing and running the model
model <- multinom(end_status ~ profit_loss + manager_changes, data = data)

summary_model <- summary(model)

# Obtaining coefficients and standard error values
coefs <- summary_model$coefficients
std_errs <- summary_model$standard.errors

# Measuring and calculating the magnitude of impact
abs_effects <- abs(coefs)


# Combining impact magnitude values into one table
effect_table <- data.frame(
  Outcome = rownames(coefs),
  Net_Spend_Impact = abs_effects[,"profit_loss"],
  Manager_Changes_Impact = abs_effects[,"manager_changes"]
)

print(effect_table)


```

```{r}

z_scores <- coefs / std_errs
z_scores
# Calculating p-values with Z-scores
p_values <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z_scores)))


p_values
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




Hypothesis 2

H0: There is no significant difference in features between teams that were relagted qdfter oneseason and temas that were relgated after multiple seasons in the EPL


```{r}
install.packages("MVN")

```

```{r}


# Load necessary libraries
library(car)
library(ggplot2)
library(MVN)
library(psych)

# Simplifying the variables
manager_changes <- relegation_df$Manager_Changes
net_spend <- relegation_df$Profit_Loss
end_status <- as.factor(relegation_df$End_Status)

# Grouping the features together for various statistical analyses
dependent_vars <- relegation_df[, c("Manager_Changes", "Profit_Loss")]

# Normality Tests for each

# Testing normality in each relegation category with Shapiro-Wilk's  (per group)
by(dependent_vars, end_status, function(sub) {
  apply(sub, 2, shapiro.test)
})

# Q-Q Plots
qqnorm(manager_changes); qqline(manager_changes, col = "red")
qqnorm(net_spend); qqline(net_spend, col = "blue")

# Multivariate Normality (Mardia’s Test)
mvn(data = dependent_vars, mvnTest = "mardia")

# Testing data homogeneity of variance for each variable
leveneTest(Manager_Changes ~ End_Status, data = relegation_df)
leveneTest(Profit_Loss ~ End_Status, data = relegation_df)


# Boxplots for each feature and relegation category
ggplot(relegation_df, aes(x = End_Status, y = Manager_Changes)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Manager Changes by Group")

ggplot(relegation_df, aes(x = End_Status, y = Profit_Loss)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightgreen") +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Net Spend by Group")

# Histograms for each feature to visualize distribution.
hist(manager_changes, main = "Histogram of Manager Changes", col = "skyblue", breaks = 10)
hist(net_spend, main = "Histogram of Profit/Loss", col = "lightgreen", breaks = 10)

### 5. Correlation Between Manager changes and Net Spend
cor.test(manager_changes, net_spend)



```



```{r}

h2_data <- read_excel("/Users/edward/Downloads/EPL data.xlsx", sheet = "Season Summary")

install.packages("caret")

#Excluding the category 'Survived' so the data frame only involves the relegated categories.
relegation_df <- h2_data[h2_data$End_Status != "Survived", ]
head(relegation_df)

#Adjusting data points to they are compatible with the model
relegation_df[relegation_df == "NAN"] <- NA

#Adjusting the name of the column so it compatible with the model.
names(relegation_df)[names(relegation_df) == "Profit/Loss"] <- "Profit_Loss"


#Multivariate ANOVA model
h2_model <- manova(cbind(Manager_Changes, Profit_Loss) ~ End_Status, data = relegation_df)
summary(h2_model, test = "Pillai")

```

```{r}
head(relegation_df)
